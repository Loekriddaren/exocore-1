title: Github Tutorial for Exocore

## 1. Create a Github Account

## 2. Install Github

### Github Desktop

### Github CLI

## 3. Saving Changes to Github

### Github Web

### Github Desktop

### Github CLI

Next, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:

$ git clone <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> my-digital-garden
As a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):

$ git clone git@github.com:maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template.git my-digital-garden
Then, navigate into the directory that was just created:

$ cd my-digital-garden

You can now return to the main tutorial.
