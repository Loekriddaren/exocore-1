## Customization

Please see the following guides for Jekyll customization

Default CSS is in ```_sass/_style.scss``` and default HTML layouts are in ```_layouts``` and ```_includes```.


## Changing Favicon

Favicon is the tiny icon that shows up on your browser tab. To create one, use a [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). Follow the steps and download the .zip file. Replace all the files in `/assets/icon` with your new icons.

You don't need to worry about the HTML code, it's already automatically added to every page.
